# 📄 1148. Article Views I  

## 📌 Problem Statement  
Given a table **Views**, find all authors who have **viewed at least one of their own articles**.  

Return the result as a **single-column DataFrame** with the column name `"id"`, sorted in **ascending order**.  

---

## 🗂 **DataFrame Schema**  
### **Table: Views**  
| Column Name | Type | Description                           |
| ----------- | ---- | ------------------------------------- |
| article_id  | int  | ID of the article                     |
| author_id   | int  | ID of the article's author            |
| viewer_id   | int  | ID of the user who viewed the article |
| view_date   | date | Date when the article was viewed      |

- **author_id == viewer_id** → Author viewed their own article  
- There is **no primary key**, meaning duplicates may exist.

## 🔹 **Modify Columns**  
| Column in Output | Renamed From |
| ---------------- | ------------ |
| id               | author_id    |

## 🔢 **Example 1**  

### **Input:**  
#### Views Table:  
| article_id | author_id | viewer_id | view_date  |
| ---------- | --------- | --------- | ---------- |
| 1          | 3         | 5         | 2019-08-01 |
| 1          | 3         | 6         | 2019-08-02 |
| 2          | 7         | 7         | 2019-08-01 |
| 2          | 7         | 6         | 2019-08-02 |
| 4          | 7         | 1         | 2019-07-22 |
| 3          | 4         | 4         | 2019-07-21 |
| 3          | 4         | 4         | 2019-07-21 |

### **Output:**  
| id  |
| --- |
| 4   |
| 7   |

### **Explanation:**  
- **Author 7** viewed their own article **(row 3)**.  
- **Author 4** viewed their own article **(row 6, 7)**.  
- **Author 3** never viewed their own article.  

The result is sorted in **ascending order**.

---

## 🔒 **Constraints**  
- **At least one row** exists in the **Views** table.  
- **Duplicate rows** may exist.  
- **Each author_id is unique in the result.**  

---

## 🐼 **Pandas Solution**  

```python
import pandas as pd

def article_views(views: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:
    # Filter rows where author_id is equal to viewer_id
    result = views[views["author_id"] == views["viewer_id"]][["author_id"]]
    
    # Drop duplicates to get unique author IDs
    result = result.drop_duplicates()
    
    # Rename column as required and sort the result
    result.columns = ["id"]
    result = result.sort_values(by="id").reset_index(drop=True)
    
    return result
