# 1757. Recyclable and Low Fat Products

## 🏆 Problem Statement

### **Table: Products**

| Column Name | Type |
| ----------- | ---- |
| product_id  | int  |
| low_fats    | enum |
| recyclable  | enum |

- `product_id` is the **primary key** (column with unique values) for this table.  
- `low_fats` is an ENUM of type (`'Y'`, `'N'`) where **'Y'** means the product is **low fat** and **'N'** means it is not.  
- `recyclable` is an ENUM of type (`'Y'`, `'N'`) where **'Y'** means the product is **recyclable** and **'N'** means it is not.  

### ❓ Write a solution to find the `product_id` of products that are **both low fat and recyclable**.

### ✅ Return the result table in any order.

## 🔹 Example 1:

### **Input:**  
#### `Products` table:

| product_id | low_fats | recyclable |
| ---------- | -------- | ---------- |
| 0          | Y        | N          |
| 1          | Y        | Y          |
| 2          | N        | Y          |
| 3          | Y        | Y          |
| 4          | N        | N          |

### **Output:**

| product_id |
| ---------- |
| 1          |
| 3          |

### **Explanation:**
- **Product 1** and **Product 3** are both **low fat (`'Y'`)** and **recyclable (`'Y'`)**, so they are included in the result.
- Other products do not satisfy both conditions.

## 💡 Solution in Pandas 🐼

```python
import pandas as pd

def find_products(products: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:
    # Filter products that are both low fat ('Y') and recyclable ('Y')
    result = products[(products["low_fats"] == "Y") & (products["recyclable"] == "Y")]

    # Select only the product_id column
    return result[["product_id"]]
```
