# 1873. Calculate Special Bonus

## Problem Statement

### Table: Employees

| Column Name | Type    |
| ----------- | ------- |
| employee_id | int     |
| name        | varchar |
| salary      | int     |

- `employee_id` is the **primary key** (unique column) for this table.
- Each row represents an **employee's ID, name, and salary**.

### Task
Write an SQL query to **calculate the bonus** of each employee. The bonus is determined as follows:

- **100% of salary** if:
  - The `employee_id` is **odd**.
  - The `name` does **not** start with the letter `'M'`.
- Otherwise, the bonus is **0**.

The result table should be ordered by `employee_id`.

## Example 1

### Input:
#### Employees Table:

| employee_id | name    | salary |
| ----------- | ------- | ------ |
| 2           | Meir    | 3000   |
| 3           | Michael | 3800   |
| 7           | Addilyn | 7400   |
| 8           | Juan    | 6100   |
| 9           | Kannon  | 7700   |

### Output:

| employee_id | bonus |
| ----------- | ----- |
| 2           | 0     |
| 3           | 0     |
| 7           | 7400  |
| 8           | 0     |
| 9           | 7700  |

### Explanation:
- **Employee 2** â†’ `Even ID` â†’ Bonus **0**.
- **Employee 3** â†’ `ID is Odd`, but `Name starts with 'M'` â†’ Bonus **0**.
- **Employee 7** â†’ `ID is Odd`, `Name does NOT start with 'M'` â†’ Bonus **7400**.
- **Employee 8** â†’ `Even ID` â†’ Bonus **0**.
- **Employee 9** â†’ `ID is Odd`, `Name does NOT start with 'M'` â†’ Bonus **7700**.

---

## Approach
1. **Check if `employee_id` is odd** using `MOD(employee_id, 2) = 1`.
2. **Check if `name` does not start with 'M'** using `name NOT LIKE 'M%'`.
3. **Apply conditions using `CASE WHEN`**.
4. **Sort by `employee_id`**.

---

## SQL Solution
```sql
SELECT employee_id,
       CASE
           WHEN employee_id % 2 = 1 AND name NOT LIKE 'M%' THEN salary
           ELSE 0
       END AS bonus
FROM Employees
ORDER BY employee_id;
```

---

## Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity:** **O(n)** â†’ The query scans all `n` rows.
- **Space Complexity:** **O(1)** â†’ Only one additional column (`bonus`) is computed.

---

## Summary
âœ… Uses **CASE WHEN** for conditional calculations.
âœ… Uses **MOD() & LIKE** for logical checks.
âœ… Orders the result by `employee_id`.
âœ… **Efficient and readable solution.** ðŸš€
