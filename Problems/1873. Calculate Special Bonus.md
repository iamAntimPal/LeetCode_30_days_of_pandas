# 1873. Calculate Special Bonus

## Problem Statement
You are given a table `Employees` containing employee details.

### Table Schema:

| Column Name | Type    |
| ----------- | ------- |
| employee_id | int     |
| name        | varchar |
| salary      | int     |

- `employee_id` is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
- Each row of this table indicates the employee ID, name, and salary.

### Task
Write a solution to calculate the **bonus** of each employee. The bonus is **100% of their salary** if:
- The `employee_id` is an **odd number**, and
- The employee's `name` **does not start with 'M'**.

Otherwise, the bonus should be `0`.

Return the result **ordered by `employee_id`**.

## Example 1

### Input:
**Employees table:**
| employee_id | name    | salary |
| ----------- | ------- | ------ |
| 2           | Meir    | 3000   |
| 3           | Michael | 3800   |
| 7           | Addilyn | 7400   |
| 8           | Juan    | 6100   |
| 9           | Kannon  | 7700   |

### Output:
| employee_id | bonus |
| ----------- | ----- |
| 2           | 0     |
| 3           | 0     |
| 7           | 7400  |
| 8           | 0     |
| 9           | 7700  |

### Explanation:
- Employees **2 and 8** get `0` bonus because their `employee_id` is even.
- Employee **3** gets `0` bonus because their name starts with `'M'`.
- Employees **7 and 9** meet the conditions and receive a **100% bonus**.

## Solution (Pandas)
```python
import pandas as pd

def calculate_special_bonus(employees: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:
    # Calculate bonus using conditions
    employees["bonus"] = employees.apply(
        lambda x: x["salary"] if x["employee_id"] % 2 != 0 and not x["name"].startswith('M') else 0, axis=1
    )
    
    # Select required columns and sort by employee_id
    result = employees[["employee_id", "bonus"]].sort_values(by="employee_id")
    
    return result
```

## Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity:** $$O(n)$$ - We iterate through all rows once.
- **Space Complexity:** $$O(1)$$ - We modify the DataFrame in place.
